2. Water quality matrix and unified database (Joanna)
 - Updated matrix in Excel format
 - "The Big Seven" - will add programs
 - This project is focused on nutrients (less so on temp. and sal.)
 - 20-30 programs w/temp and sal which could be included, would be a heavy lift
 - "Water Quality Data Team" is what they call our FDEP/AOML/USF project
 - Will post to team website (Add link HERE)
 - McEachron 2022 ("Big 7") item on March meeting summary

### Discussion of draft plan from March meeting
 - Lots of challenges in developing a monitoring plan
 - Look at other programs
 - Look beyond standard WQ metrics
 - Do we know what "good" levels of WQ are? (No - I. Enochs)
 - What management levers are available? What can we do if we do see changes?
 - How fast can we get data? What are the time frames?
 - Are there commercial solutions (satellites/sondes) to help solve this?
 - Adaptive/iterative approach?
 - Let's focus on our primary tasks and not widen the net too much (Joanna)
 - How do we define Everglades Restoration?
 - Restore flows (how will this affect FL Bay?)
 - How can we assess where the water is going?
 - What is the ROI (all reefs? Patch reefs?)
 - With large inflows into FL Bay, what/where are the impacts?

### Next meeting on September 7th, 2023 - could be in-person
