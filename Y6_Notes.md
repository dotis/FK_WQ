### Notes for Y6 (2026)

1. Data has been transitioned to SEACAR
2. Program 10006 in on the SEACAR webpage (lacks overall WQ file, but program provided files are there.
3. Dan will continue data analysis w/warped data

### Issues oberved using Shiny app
1. SFER - Many stations have "deep" values also included
2. Some stations (e.g. 9.5 show up to four values per day) - This is suspicious

### Issues observed from Quarto report (provider reports)  
#### No Map - "Cannot make map: All rows have missing latitude or longitude."  
1. Bad lat/lon:
FIU_WQMP_RECENT (FIU_WQMP and FIU_WQMP_HISTORICAL is ok)  
PALM_BEACH and PALM_BEACH_STORET  
BROWARD_STORET (BROWARD is ok)  
BBWQ_STORET (BBWQ is ok)
