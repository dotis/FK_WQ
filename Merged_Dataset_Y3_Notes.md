## Notes on Y3 Merged FKWQ Dataset

1. Many SERC slopes are duplicated in 'Chla Slopes.csv' file.
2. There are two entries in the location file (rows 64 and 66) for "Key West NW Channel"; one is called "KW Northwest Channel"; lat/lon are identical
4. There are two entries in the location file (rows 125 and 126) for "Seven Mile Bridge" with identical names and nearly identical lat/lon

### There are two location files in the "Y3" folder:
1. "DEP Locations By Regions.csv" with 982 rows
2. "DEP Locations By Regions (sheets file)" with 969 rows

The sheets file is newer. Should I use this location file?

Also, I assume the merged datasets in xlsx form in the "Merged Datasets" and the .csv files in the "Merged Datasets and Trend Analyses" folder are the same?

### Missing slopes (not sure if this matters):
1. N Sluiceway (row 102 in location file)
2. Sta329i (row 143)
3. Sta348i (row 151)
4. Wigging Pass (row 403 - I think this must be a typo); Wiggins pass is on the next row
