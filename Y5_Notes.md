### FKWQ Year 5 Notes

#### Tasks
1. Provide support for FCRCT meetings
2. Updated database
3. Integration w/SEACAR
4. Abiotic inventory and selected database(s) (due in Decebmer 2024)
5. Fine-scale analysis of WQ spatio-temporal trends/patterns

#### Meeting with FDEP SEACAR leads (Cheryl Clark, Tyler Hill) on 9/3/24
1. Check that QC of discrete values match (compare downloaded data from SEACAR w/our data)
2. Do we need separate QC for our data? I don't think so.
3. Once #3 is assessed, meet w/USF Water Inst. (Shawn Landry, others?) - What do they need? We want to add a tab with our data and maps
4. Downloads from SEACAR are as standardized .xlsx files (no API - raw files are also on website)
5. To add maps to SEACAR, can establish a USF to USF agreement w/Shawn L.
6.
